In this exercise, we will do a simple experiment to find out the difference in performance among different CNN architectures when trained on a same image dataset.

Tasks:
1. Train at least 3 CNN models (basing them on different architectures e.g. VGG, ResNet, SqueezeNet etc.) on the weather image dataset. To make interesting comparison, include more variety of CNN designs such as models with/without skip connections, small/high amount of layers etc.
2. Keep a log of your experiment e.g. the model configurations and their respectively evaluation scores.
3. State your observations and try to explain the factors contributing to the difference in performance achieved by the models.
