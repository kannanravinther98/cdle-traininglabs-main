/**
 * Quantization is the discretization of the image pixel value.
 * The equation of quantization is given as follows:
 * floor (pixel_value / bin) * bin
 *
 * In this example, we will reduce the intensity of an image from 256 bits to 2 bits.
 *
 * TASKS:
 * -----
 * 1. Load and display lena.png from the resources/image_processing folder
 * 2. Read the image to a mat file
 * 3. Perform depth reduction algorithm using ND4J
 * 4. Display the final image
